<h1>Why Open Data?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-open-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-open-data"><em class="xref std std-term">Open data</em></a>, especially <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-open-government-data"><em class="xref std std-term">open government data</em></a>,
is a tremendous resource that is as yet largely untapped. Many
individuals and organisations collect a broad range of different types
of data in order to perform their tasks. Government is particularly
significant in this respect, both because of the quantity and centrality
of the data it collects, but also because most of that government data
is public data by law, and therefore could be made open and made
available for others to use. Why is that of interest?</p>
<p>There are many areas where we can expect open data to be of value,
and where examples of how it has been used already exist. There are also many different groups
of people and organisations who can benefit from the availability of
open data, including government itself. At the same time it is impossible
to predict precisely how and where value will be created in the future. The nature of
innovation is that developments often comes from unlikely places.</p>
<p>It is already possible to point to a large number of areas where open
government data is creating value. Some of these areas include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Transparency and democratic control</li>
<li>Participation</li>
<li>Self-empowerment</li>
<li>Improved or new private products and services</li>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Improved efficiency of government services</li>
<li>Improved effectiveness of government services</li>
<li>Impact measurement of policies</li>
<li>New knowledge from combined data sources and patterns in large data
volumes</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples exist for most of these areas.</p>
<p>In terms of transparency, projects such as the Finnish ‘tax tree’ and
British ‘where does my money go’ show how your tax money is being
spent by the government. And there’s the example of how open data saved Canada
$3.2 billion in charity tax fraud. Also various websites such as the
Danish folketsting.dk track activity in parliament and the law making
processes, so you can see what exactly is happening, and which
parliamentarians are involved.</p>
<p>Open government data can also help you to make better decisions in your
own life, or enable you to be more active in society. A woman in Denmark
built findtoilet.dk, which showed all the Danish public toilets, so that people she knew
with bladder problems can now trust themselves to go out more again. In the
Netherlands a service, vervuilingsalarm.nl, is available which warns you
with a message if the air-quality in your vicinity is going to reach a
self-defined threshold tomorrow. In New York you can easily find out
where you can walk your dog, as well as find other people who use the same
parks. Services like ‘mapumental’ in the UK and ‘mapnificent’ in Germany
allow you to find places to live, taking into account the duration of your commute to
work, housing prices, and how beautiful an area is. All
these examples use open government data.</p>
<p>Economically, open data is of great importance as well. Several studies
have estimated the economic value of open data at several tens of
billions of Euros annually in the EU alone. New products and companies
are re-using open data. The Danish husetsweb.dk helps you to find ways
of improving the energy efficiency of your home, including financial
planning and finding builders who can do the work. It is based on
re-using cadastral information and information about government subsidies,
as well as the local trade register. Google Translate uses the enormous
volume of EU documents that appear in all European languages to train
the translation algorithms, thus improving its quality of service.</p>
<p>Open data is also of value for government itself. For example, it can increase
government efficiency. The Dutch Ministry of Education has published
all of their education-related data online for re-use. Since then, the
number of questions they receive has dropped, reducing work-load and
costs, and the remaining questions are now also easier for civil
servants to answer, because it is clear where the relevant data
can be found. Open data is also making government more
effective, which ultimately also reduces costs. The Dutch department
for cultural heritage is actively releasing their data and collaborating
with amateur historical societies and groups such as the
Wikimedia Foundation in order to execute their own tasks more effectively.
This not only results in improvements to the quality of their data,
but will also ultimately make the department smaller.</p>
<p>While there are numerous instances of the ways in which open data is already creating
both social and economic value, we don’t yet know what new things will become possible. New combinations
of data can create new knowledge and insights, which can lead to whole new
fields of application. We have seen this in the past, for example when
Dr. Snow discovered the relationship between drinking water
pollution and cholera in London in the 19th century, by combining data about
cholera deaths with the location of water wells. This led to the building
of London’s sewage systems, and hugely improved the general
health of the population. We are likely to see such developments happening again as unexpected
insights flow from the combination of different open data sets.</p>
<p>This untapped potential can be unleashed if we turn public government
data into open data. This will only happen, however, if it is really open, i.e. if there
are no restrictions (legal, financial or technological) to its re-use
by others. Every restriction will exclude people from re-using the
public data, and make it harder to find valuable ways of doing that.
For the potential to be realized, public data needs to be open data.</p>
