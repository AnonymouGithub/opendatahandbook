<h1>Making things! Hackdays, prizes and prototypes<a class="headerlink" href="#making-things-hackdays-prizes-and-prototypes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The structure of these competitions is that a number of datasets
are released and programmers then have a short time-frame -
running from as little as 48 hours to a few weeks - to develop
applications using the data. A prize is then awarded to the best application.
Competitions have been held in a number of countries including
the UK, the US, Norway, Australia, Spain, Denmark and Finland.</p>
<div class="section" id="examples-for-competitions">
<h2>Examples for Competitions<a class="headerlink" href="#examples-for-competitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Show us a better way</strong> was the first such competition in the world.
It was initiated by the UK Government’s “The Power of Information
Taskforce” headed by Cabinet Office Minister Tom Watson in March 2008.
This competition asked “What would you create with public information?”
and was open to programmers from around the world, with a tempting
£80,000 prize for the five best applications.</p>
<p><strong>Apps for Democracy</strong>, one of the first competitions in the
United States, was launched in October 2008 by Vivek Kundra, at the
time Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the District of Columbia (DC)
Government. Kundra had developed the groundbreaking DC data catalogue,
<a class="reference external" href="http://data.octo.dc.gov/">http://data.octo.dc.gov/</a>, which included datasets such as real-time
crime feeds, school test scores, and poverty indicators. It was at the
time the most comprehensive local data catalogue in the world. The
challenge was to make it useful for citizens, visitors, businesses
and government agencies of Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The creative solution was to create the Apps for Democracy contest.
The strategy was to ask people to build applications using the data
from the freshly launched data catalogue. It included an online
submission for applications, many small prizes rather than a few large
ones, and several different categories as well as a “People’s
Choice” prize. The competition was open for 30 days and cost the DC
government $50,000. In return, a total of 47 iPhone, Facebook and web
applications were developed with an estimated value in excess of
$2,600,000 for the local economy.</p>
<p><strong>The Abre Datos (Open Data) Challenge 2010</strong>. Held in Spain in
April 2010, this contest invited developers to  create open source
applications making use of public data in just 48 hours. The competition
had 29 teams of participants who developed applications that included
a mobile phone programme for accessing traffic information in the Basque
Country, and for accessing data on buses and bus stops in Madrid, which
won the first and second prizes of €3,000 and €2,000 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Nettskap 2.0</strong>. In April 2010 the Norwegian Ministry for Government
Administration held &#8220;Nettskap 2.0&#8221;. Norwegian developers – companies,
public agencies or individuals – were challenged to come up with
web-based project ideas in the areas of service development, efficient
work processes, and increased democratic participation. The use of
government data was explicitly encouraged. Though the application
deadline was just a month later, on May 9, the Minister Rigmor Aasrud
said the response was &#8220;overwhelming&#8221;. In total 137 applications were
received, no less than 90 of which built on the reuse of government
data. A total amount of NOK 2.5 million was distributed among the
17 winners; while the total amount applied for by the 137 applications
was NOK 28.4 million.</p>
<p><strong>Mashup Australia</strong>. The Australian Government 2.0 Taskforce invited
citizens to show why open access to Australian government information
would be positive for the country’s economy and social development.
The contest ran from October 7th to November 13th 2009. The Taskforce
released some datasets under an open licence and in a range of reusable
formats. The 82 applications that were entered into the contest are further
evidence of the new and innovative applications which can result from
releasing government data on open terms.</p>

<h2>Conferences, Barcamps, Hackdays<a class="headerlink" href="#conferences-barcamps-hackdays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the more effective ways for Civil Society Organisations (CSOs)
to demonstrate to governments the value of opening up their datasets
is to show the multiple ways in which the information can be managed
to achieve social and economic benefit. CSOs that promote reuse
have been instrumental in countries where there have been advances in
policy and law to ensure that datasets are both technically and legally
open.</p>
<p>The typical activities which are undertaken as part of these initiatives
normally include competitions, <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-open-government-data"><em class="xref std std-term">open government data</em></a> conferences,
“unconferences”, workshops and “hack days”. These activities are often
organised by the user community with data that has already been
published proactively or obtained using access to information requests.
In other cases, civil society advocates have worked with progressive
public officials to secure new release of datasets that can be used
by programmers to create innovative applications.</p>
