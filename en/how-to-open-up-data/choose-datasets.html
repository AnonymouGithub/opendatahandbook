<h1>Choose Dataset(s)<a class="headerlink" href="#choose-dataset-s" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Choosing the dataset(s) you plan to make open is the first step –
though remember that the whole process of opening up data is iterative and you
can return to this step if you encounter problems later on.</p>
<p>If you already know exactly what dataset(s) you plan to open up you can
move straight on to the next section. However, in many cases, especially
for large institutions, choosing which datasets to focus on is a challenge.
How should one proceed in this case?</p>
<p>Creating this list should be a quick process that identifies which datasets
could be made open to start with. There will be time at later stages to
check in detail whether each dataset is suitable.</p>
<p>There is <strong>no requirement</strong> to create a comprehensive list of your
datasets. The main point to bear in mind is whether it is feasible
to publish this data at all (whether openly or otherwise) -
see the ‘What Data’ section above.</p>
<div class="section" id="asking-the-community">
<h2>Asking the community<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-the-community" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We recommend that you ask the community in the first instance. That is
the people who will be accessing and using the data, as they are likely to have
a good understanding of which data could be valuable.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Prepare a short list of potential datasets that you would like
feedback on. It is not essential that this list concurs with
your expectations, the main intention is to get a feel for the
demand. This could be based on other countries&#8217; <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-open-data"><em class="xref std std-term">open data</em></a>
catalogues.</li>
<li>Create a request for comment.</li>
<li>Publicise your request with a webpage. Make sure that it is possible
to access the request through its own URL. That way, when shared via
social media, the request can be easily found.</li>
<li>Provide easy ways to submit responses. Avoid requiring registration,
as it reduces the number of responses.</li>
<li>Circulate the request to relevant mailing lists, forums and individuals,
pointing back to the main webpage.</li>
<li>Run a consultation event. Make sure you run it at a convenient time
where the average business person, data wrangler and official can
attend.</li>
<li>Ask a politician to speak on your agency&#8217;s behalf. Open data is very
likely to be part of a wider policy of increasing access to government
information.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cost-basis">
<h2>Cost basis<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-basis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>How much money do agencies spend on the collection and maintainence of
data that they hold? If they spend a great deal on a particular set of
data, then it is highly likely that others would like to access it.</p>
<p>This argument may be fairly susceptible to concerns of freeriding. The
question you will need to respond to is, &#8220;Why should other people get
information for free that is so expensive?&#8221;. The answer is that the
expense is absorbed by the public sector to perform a particular function.
The cost of sending that data, once it has been collected, to a third
party is approximately nothing. Therefore, they should be charged nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ease-of-release">
<h2>Ease of release<a class="headerlink" href="#ease-of-release" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, rather than deciding which data would be most valuable, it could
be useful to take a look at which data is easiest to get into the public&#8217;s
hands. Small, easy releases can act as the catalyst for larger behavioural
change within organisations.</p>
<p>Be careful with this approach however. It may be the case that these small
releases are of so little value that nothing is built from them. If this
occurs, faith in the entire project could be undermined.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="observe-peers">
<h2>Observe peers<a class="headerlink" href="#observe-peers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Open data is a growing movement. There are likely to be many people in your
area who understand what other areas are doing. Formulate a list on the
basis of what those agencies are doing.</p>
