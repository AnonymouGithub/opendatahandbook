<h1>Make data discoverable<a class="headerlink" href="#make-data-discoverable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-open-data"><em class="xref std std-term">Open data</em></a> is nothing without users. You need to be able to make
sure that people can find the source material. This section will cover
different approaches.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to provide a neutral space
which can overcome both inter-agency politics and future budget cycles.
Jurisdictional borders, whether sectorial or geographical, can make
cooperation difficult. However, there are significant benefits in joining
forces. The easier it is for outsiders to discover data, the faster new
and useful tools will be built.</p>
<div class="section" id="existing-tools">
<h2>Existing tools<a class="headerlink" href="#existing-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of tools which are live on the web that are specifically
designed to make data most discoverable.</p>
<p>The most prominent is CKAN.net. CKAN stands for the Comprehensive Knowledge
Archive Network, and is a catalogue of all datasets in the world. The site
makes it very easy for developers to find the material that they&#8217;re seeking.</p>
<p>In addition, there are dozens of specialist catalogues for different
sectors and places. Many scientific communities have created a catalogue
system for their fields, as data are often required for publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-government">
<h2>For government<a class="headerlink" href="#for-government" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As it has emerged, orthodox practice is for a lead agency to create a
catalogue for the government&#8217;s data. When establishing a catalogue, try to
create some structure which allows many departments to easily keep their own
information current.</p>
<p>Resist the urge to build the software to support the catalogue from scratch.
There are many free and open source software solutions which have been
adopted by many dozens of governments already. Investing in another
platform will be a waste of resources.</p>
<p>There are a few things that most open data catalogues miss. Your programme
could consider the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Providing an avenue to allow the private and community sectors to add
their data. It may be worthwhile to think of the catalogue as the region&#8217;s
catalogue, rather than the regional government&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Facilitating improvement of the data by allowing derivatives of datasets
to be catalogued. For example, someone may geocode addresses and may
wish to share those results with everybody. If you only allow single
versions of datasets, these improvements remain hidden.</li>
<li>Be tolerant of your data appearing elsewhere. That is, content is likely
to be duplicated to communities of interest. If you have river level
monitoring data available, then your data may appear in a catalogue
for hydrologists.</li>
<li>Ensure that access is equitable. Do not create a privileged level of
access for officials or tenured researchers. This will cause resentment
and ultimately undermine the goals that you are seeking to achive.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="for-civil-society">
<h3>For civil society<a class="headerlink" href="#for-civil-society" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Be willing to create a supplementary catalogue for non-official data.</p>
<p>It is very rare for governments to associate with unofficial or
non-authoritative sources. Officials have often gone to great expense to
ensure that there will not be political embarrasment or other harm
caused from misuse or overreliance on data.</p>
<p>Moreover, governments are unlikely to be willing to support activities
that mesh their information with information from businesses. Governments
are rightfully skeptical of profit motives. Therefore, an independent
catalogue for community groups, businesses and others may be warranted.</p>
