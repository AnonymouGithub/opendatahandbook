<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Do you know exactly how much of your tax money is spent on street lights
or on cancer research? What is the shortest, safest and most scenic bicycle
route from your home to your work? And what is in the air that you breathe along
the way? Where in your region will you find the best job opportunities and
the highest number of fruit trees per capita? When can you influence
decisions about topics you deeply care about, and whom should you talk to?</p>
<p>New technologies now make it possible to build the services to answer these
questions automatically. Much of the data you would need to answer these
questions is generated by public bodies. However, often the data required
is not yet available in a form which is easy to use. This book is
about how to unlock the potential of official and other information to
enable new services, to improve the lives of citizens and to make government
and society work better.</p>
<p>The notion of <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-open-data"><em class="xref std std-term">open data</em></a> and specifically
<a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-open-government-data"><em class="xref std std-term">open government data</em></a> - information, public or otherwise, which
anyone is free to access and re-use for any purpose - has been around
for some years. In 2009 open data started to become visible in the
mainstream, with various governments (such as the USA, UK, Canada and
New Zealand) announcing new initiatives towards opening up their public
information.</p>
<p>This book explains the basic concepts of ‘open data’, especially in
relation to government. It covers how open data creates value and
can have a positive impact in many different areas. In addition to exploring the background,
the handbook also provides concrete information on how to produce open
data.</p>
<div class="section" id="target-audience">
<h2>Target Audience<a class="headerlink" href="#target-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This handbook has a broad audience:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>for those who have never heard of open data before and those
who consider themselves seasoned ‘data professionals’</li>
<li>for civil servants and for activists</li>
<li>for journalists and researchers</li>
<li>for politicians and developers</li>
<li>for data geeks and those who have never heard of an API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the information currently provided is focused on data held by
the public sector. However, the authors intentions are to broaden this
as time permits. You are welcome to participate to help us with that
effort.</p>
<p>This handbook is intended for those with little or no knowledge of the
topic. If you do find a piece of jargon or terminology with which you
aren&#8217;t familiar, please see the detailed Glossary and FAQs (frequently
asked questions) which can be found at the end of the handbook.</p>
