====================
The Open Data Manual
====================

**This report discusses legal, social and technical aspects of open data.** The manual can be used by anyone but is especially designed for those seeking to **open up** data. It discusses the **why, what and how** of open data -- why to go open, what open is, and the how to 'open' data.

To get started, you may wish to look at the <a href="/summary/">Summary</a> and the <a href="/introduction/">Introduction</a>. You can navigate through the report using the Table of Contents (via the book icon) or by using the arrows at the top of the page.

We warmly welcome comments on the text. Simply click the speech bubble icons to the left of the paragraph you'd like to comment on!
