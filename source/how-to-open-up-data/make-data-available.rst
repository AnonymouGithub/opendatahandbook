Make Data Available (Technical Openness)
========================================

Open data needs to be ‘technically’ open as well as legally open. Specifically the data needs be:

   1. **Available** - at no more than a reasonable cost of reproduction, preferably for free download on the Internet. Summary: publish your information on the Internet wherever possible.
   2. **In bulk.** The data should be available as a whole (a web API or service may also be very useful but is not a substitute for bulk access)
   3. **In an open, machine-readable format.** Machine-readability is important because it facilitates reuse, for example, tables of figures in a PDF can be read easily by humans but are very hard for a computer to use which greatly limits the ability to reuse that data.

The key point to keep in mind here is: **keep it simple, move fast and be pragmatic**. In particular it is better to give out raw data now than perfect data in six months time.

Availability, Bulk, APIs etc
============================

There are many different ways to make data available. The most natural in the Internet age being publication online - though distribution via other formats including physical media such as DVDs or flash drives should not be discounted.

Focusing on the online option, the data can be published on web pages, exposed via a query interface on a website, or via an Application Programming Interface (API). Making information available via an API can ensure that it is up to date – or even available in real time.

Making data available via an API where possible, but that this is secondary to publishing raw data in bulk.

This is important because bulk access ensures that: a) there is no dependency on the original provider of the data; anyone else can obtain a bulk copy and redistribute it b) bulk access is essential certain others can develop their own services using the data and

This allows others to use the data beyond read-only access. For example, it allows batch conversion it into a new format, linking and integration with other resources, archival in multiple places, and so on12. While the latest version of the data may be made available via an API, raw data should be made available in bulk at regular intervals.

For example, the Eurostat statistical service has a bulk download facility offering over 4000 data files. It is updated twice a day, offers data in Tab Separate Value (TSV) format, and includes documentation about the download facility as well as about the data files13.

Another example is the District of Columbia OCTO’s Data Catalogue, which allows data to be downloaded in CSV and XLS format, in addition to live feeds of the data.
