Make Data Available (Technical Openness)
========================================

Open data needs to be ‘technically’ open as well as legally open. Specifically the data needs be:

   1. **Available** - at no more than a reasonable cost of reproduction, preferably for free download on the Internet. Summary: publish your information on the Internet wherever possible.
   2. **In bulk.** The data should be available as a whole (a web API or service may also be very useful but is not a substitute for bulk access)
   3. **In an open, machine-readable format.** Machine-readability is important because it facilitates reuse, for example, tables of figures in a PDF can be read easily by humans but are very hard for a computer to use which greatly limits the ability to reuse that data.

The key point to keep in mind here is: **keep it simple, move fast and be pragmatic**. In particular it is better to give out raw data now than perfect data in six months time.
