This manual is intended for a broad audience: for those who have never heard of open data before and for those who consider themselves seasoned ‘data professionals’; for civil servants and for activists; for journalists and researchers; for politicians and developers; for data geeks and those who have never heard of an API.

This manual is intended for those with little or no knowledge of the topic. If you do find a piece of jargon or terminology with which you aren't familiar please see the detailed Glossary and FAQs (frequently asked questions) which can be found at the end of the manual.
