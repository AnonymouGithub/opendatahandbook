  Data protection legislation
    Data protection legislation is not about protecting the data, 
    but the right of citizens to live without doubt of the consequences 
    that might come if information of their private lives becomes public. 
    The law protects the privacy (such as information about a person 
    economic status, health and political position) and other rights 
    such as the right to freedom of movement and assembly. For example, 
    in Finland a travel card system used record all instances when the 
    card was shown to the reader machine on different public transport 
    lines. This raised a debate from the perspective of freedom of 
    movement and the travel card data collection was abandoned based 
    on the data protection legislation.

  EU PSI Directive
    The *Directive on the re-use of public sector information*,
    2003/98/EC. "deals with the way public sector bodies should 
    enhance re-use of their information resources." `Legislative Actions - PSI Directive <http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/actions_eu/policy_actions/index_en.htm>`_ 

  Information Asset Register
    IARs are registers specifically set up to capture and organise 
    meta-data about the vast quantities of information held by 
    government departments and agencies. A comprehensive IAR includes 
    databases, old sets of files, recent electronic files, collections 
    of statistics, research and so forth.

    The :EU PSI Directive: recognises the importance of asset registers 
    for prospective re-users of public information. It requires that 
    member states provide lists, portals, or something similar. It states::

       Tools that help potential re-users to find documents available 
       for re-use and the conditions for re-use can facilitate 
       considerably the cross-border use of public sector documents. 
       Member States should therefore ensure that practical arrangements 
       are in place that help re-users in their search for documents 
       available for reuse. Assets lists, accessible preferably online, 
       of main documents (documents that are extensively re-used or 
       that have the potential to be extensively re-used), and portal 
       sites that are linked to decentralised assets lists are examples 
       of such practical arrangements.

    IARs can be developed in different ways. Government departments 
    can develop their own IARs and these can be linked to a national 
    IARs. IARs can include information which is held by public bodies 
    but which has not yet been – and maybe will not be – proactively 
    published. Hence they allow members of the public to identify 
    information which exists and which can be requested.

    For the public to make use of these IARs, it is important that any 
    registers of information held be as complete as possible in order 
    to be able to have confidence that documents can be found. The 
    lack of completeness of some registers is a significant problem as 
    it creates a degree of unreliability which may discourage some from 
    using the registers to search for information.

    It is essential that the metadata in the IARs be comprehensive so 
    that search engines can function effectively. In the spirit of 
    open government data, public bodies should make available their 
    IARs to the general public as raw data under an open licence so 
    that civic hackers can make use of the data, for example by building 
    search engines and user interfaces.
